# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Deliver a working cross-platform navigation MVP within 7 days that visualizes shortest car routes
- Enable users to see optimal driving paths with zero learning curve (tap destination, see route)
- Achieve 100% open-source implementation with zero API costs or vendor dependencies
- Create a privacy-first alternative to commercial navigation apps without data collection or tracking
- Validate cross-platform Flutter deployment on Android and iOS mobile platforms
- Establish foundational codebase for community-driven open-source navigation project

## Background Context

Modern navigation applications like Waze and Google Maps offer comprehensive features but overwhelm users who simply need basic route visualization. These apps require large downloads (100+ MB), extensive permissions, constant connectivity, and collect significant user data. The open-source community and privacy-conscious users lack a lightweight, transparent alternative focused on core functionality.

With mature open-source infrastructure now available (OpenStreetMap, OSRM, GraphHopper), NaviMap fills this gap by providing an ultra-simple navigation experience: display an interactive map, allow tap-to-set destination, and calculate the shortest car route using free open-source services. The MVP deliberately excludes turn-by-turn navigation, address search, and other complexity to maintain focus and achieve a one-week development timeline with AI-assisted development.

## Stakeholders

**Primary:**
- Solo developer (with AI assistance) - responsible for implementation and delivery

**Secondary:**
- End users (general drivers, privacy-conscious smartphone users) - validate product value
- Open-source community (future contributors) - long-term sustainability and enhancement

**Tertiary:**
- App store reviewers (Google Play Store, Apple App Store) - approval for distribution
- OSM/OSRM communities - ensure compliance with usage policies
