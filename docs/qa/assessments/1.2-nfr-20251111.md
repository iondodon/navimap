# NFR Assessment – Story 1.2 (Interactive Map Display with OpenStreetMap)

| NFR             | Status   | Evidence                                                                                                                   | Gaps / Follow-Up                                                                                           |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Security        | PASS     | Map tiles fetched over HTTPS with package-qualified user agent; no sensitive data stored.                                  | None identified.                                                                                           |
| Performance     | CONCERNS | Connectivity probe times out after 3 s and map overlay prevents interaction until ready, but no empirical timing captured. | Capture launch-to-first-tile and gesture latency measurements on target devices; add automated guardrails. |
| Reliability     | PASS     | Offline placeholder and retry mechanisms verified via widget tests.                                                        | Consider logging connectivity transitions for observability in production builds.                          |
| Maintainability | PASS     | Stateless `MapScreen` with Provider-based `AppState`; code is modular and test-friendly.                                   | Ensure future camera state consumers subscribe to notifier updates if needed.                              |

## Notes

- Performance remains the dominant NFR risk because acceptance thresholds are requirements-level metrics without attached evidence.
- Reliability would benefit from additional telemetry once analytics infrastructure is available, but current implementation meets MVP expectations.
