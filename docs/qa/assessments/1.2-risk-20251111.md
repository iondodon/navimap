## Risk Matrix

| ID  | Risk Description                                                                             | Probability (1-3) | Impact (1-3) | Score | Notes                                                                         | Mitigation                                                                                 |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| R1  | Performance acceptance criteria (3 s load, 100 ms interactions) lack empirical measurements. | 3                 | 2            | 6     | Without profiling evidence we cannot confirm the NFRs hold on target devices. | Capture launch/gesture timings on representative hardware and attach results to the story. |
| R2  | Widget tests hit live OpenStreetMap tiles during CI runs.                                    | 2                 | 2            | 4     | External dependency can introduce flakiness and rate-limit issues.            | Stub tile HTTP requests in tests using a fake `HttpClient` or local fixture service.       |

## Observations

- No critical (score ≥ 9) risks identified, but the unverified performance metrics remain a gating concern until evidence is supplied.
- Security posture for map tile access is acceptable (HTTPS, scoped user agent), so no additional risks logged.

## Recommended Follow-Up

1. Add deterministic performance measurement (e.g., integration test or profiling script) before release.
2. Replace live network tile fetching in widget tests with a deterministic stub to keep the test suite self-contained.
